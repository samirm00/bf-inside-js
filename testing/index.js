/* A JavaScript call stack is an example of a stack data structure. In a JS call stack, the elements are function invocations. Every time you invoke a function, itâ€™s added to the stack. If it has a nested function, that nested function will get added to the top of the stack as well, and so on. You can think of the call stack as a to-do list of sorts for JavasScript.
